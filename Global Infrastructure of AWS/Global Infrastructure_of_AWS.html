                Topic 3 : Availability Zones 

                Topic 4 : Local Zones 

                Topic 5 : Edge Location 

                Topic 6 : CloudFront 


            ==> Topic 1 : Introduction to AWS Global Infrastructure 

                  As of mid-2025, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has 33 active regions and 108 Availability Zones (AZs) globally, 
                  with plans to add six new regions (Mexico, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Taiwan, and 
                  the AWS European Sovereign Cloud) and 18 new Availability Zones in the near future.

                  In amazon console, when you click on AWS Regional Services, You will get all the list of AWS Services Available by Region 
                  AWS Edge Network Locations  (Services offered in the regions).
                  
               **** Factors behind region selection (why should i select this region based on what)

                     1 factor : Compliance with data governance and legal requirements 

                     2 factor : Latency 

                     3 factor : Available Services within a Region 

                     4 factor : Cost
                     
                ==>  Availability Zones :
                
                            Region - Mumbai (ap-south-1)

                            in this Region the availabilty zones are 3 

                            Availability Zones-1  

                            Availability Zones-2 

                            Availability Zones-3

                 Each availability zone has multiple data centers - how many data centers are there means it not disclosed
                 Availability Zones are Collections of data. 

                 Important Question : Each Avilability Zone is 100km away from each other. Now, Question comes why there is a 100km 
                                      between two availability Zones ?
                         let's take an Example, Mumbai Region has three Availability zones. 
                         availability zones are within 1 km. Now, we know that Mumbai is famous for flood now
                         if flood is there, all availability Zone will go down in one go or if there is any natural Calamity any natural 
                         thing which is happening like earthquake or something like that. So all availability Zone will go down simultaneously. So in order to
                         keep High availability, please make a note of it in order to keep High availability. what happens a distance of
                         100 km is kept between two availability zones.

                ==> Local Zones : 
                
                    AWS Local Zones are a type of infrastructure deployment that places compute, storage, database and other select AWS services 
                    close to large population and insustry centers.

                    Latency sensitive application : 

                        - Real time Gaming
                        - AR/VR 
                        - Media and Entertainment 
                        - Video Streaming 

                    ** Runs latency sensitive applications closer to end users. 

                       Availabity zones are the parents to local zones 
                       Chennai and Bangalore local zones are under the Hyderabad (parent)
                
                ==> Edge Location : 

                      A site that CloudFront users to cache copies of your content for faster delivery to users at any location. 

                      To deliver content to end users with lower latency, Amazon CloudFront uses a global network of 550+ Points of presence and 
                      13 regional edge caches in 100+ cities across 50 countries.

                      Amazon CloudFront Edge locations are located in India : 
                      New Delhi,India (14); 
                      Chennai, India (8);
                      Mumbai, India (8);
                      Pune, India (4);
                      Bangalore, India(5);
                      Hyderabad, India (5);
                      Kolkata, India (4);


                      origin -----caching site---------Edge Location ----------User

                     All Regions are connected by Backbone Network fiber cables, so they are connected via
                     AWS backbone Network and this backbone fiber cables are floating in pacific and Atlantic Oceans. 


                     Let's talk about origin is South America where there is some data or some application running now if I want to access this
                     application from India. So what I will do I will be doing. I'll be using cloudfront service means I'll be using as locations of India and 
                     India have so many Edge locations like in Delhi(There are 14 edge locations),in Chennai(8), Mumbai(8), Pune(8), Bangalore(5) Hyderabad(5) Kolkata(4).
                     So like this. We have a different part of the world. Which have so many edge locations nearly 400+ locations. So now if I have to watch our
                     content, so this content will be cached , this caching site to the edge location now all the users which are there in India or closer to
                     India will be watching their content from their nearest Edge location instead of watching the content from origin from South America. They'll be
                     watching a content from where from their nearest Edge location and who will help the help that cloudfront.
                     cloudfront service will help them. What is cloudfront? - cloudfront is the content delivery network service.
                     So To deliver content to end users with lower latency, Amazon CloudFront uses a global network of 550+ Points of presence and 
                     13 regional edge caches in 100+ cities across 50 countries.

                     So what our regional edge cache 
                     About Edge caching, but what is regional which have greater size than these caches now ? 
                     What are caches?  caches are a memory which has a limited memory and every cache has a TTL value (time to live) 
                     that is how long our data can live in this caching because our data could be old data stale data. So time to
                     live let's say I'm setting a by default time 24 hours. after 24 hours it will get deleted. 

            ==> Cloud Front : CDN SERVICE 
                ------------- 

                Amazon CloudFront is a web service that gives businesses and web application developers an easy amd cost effective way to 
                distribute content with low latency and high data transfer speeds. Like other AWS services, Amazon CloudFront is a self-service, pay-per-use offering,
                requiring no long-term commitments or minimum fees. With CloudFront, your files are delivered to end-users using a global network of edge locations.
