                *** IP ADDRESSING AND CIDR ***

    ==> IPV4 Address and CIDR :

           
       Internet Protocol Version 4 : 192.168.25.7 = 32 bits 
                                      8 . 8. 8. 8 = 32 bits 

                                here 192 is the decimal form its not bits. 
                                
                     192. 168. 25. 7

                           2^7  2^6  2^5  2^4  2^3  2^2  2^1  2^0

                           128  64    32   16   8    4    2    1 

                    7 ==>   0    0    0    0    0    1    1     1

                    25 ==>  0    0     0   1    1     0    0    1

                    168 ==> 1    0     1   0    1     0    0    0

                    192 ==> 1    1     0   0    0     0    0    0
                    . 
                    . 
                    . 
                    255 ==> 1    1     1    1   1    1     1    1


        ** Make all digits one  then this become 255  (128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 +2 + 1)
           because of this you have never encountered any IP more than 255 that means any octet 
           cannot be greater than  255 because of all the digits are one then also it cannot go beyond 255
           so any ip address cannot be like this 9.3.327.421 here 327 and 421 is not possible.   

         so in binary format we can write this ip address as : 

         192.168.25.7 ==>  

                     11000000.10101000.00011001.00000111 
                     -------- -------- -------- --------
                       192       168     25        7 

        CIDR means classless inter domain routing : 

        192.168.0.0/24  here /24 means kindly block first 24 bits that means those 24 bits won't change , remaining 
        can change. 

        0 to 255 I can create 256 Ip's 
        
        Suppose Tcs organization the cider of TCS is 192.168.0.0/24

        192.168.0.0   192.168.0.1   192.168.0.2   192.168.0.3 .... 192.168.0.134 ....192.168.0.255

        here the first 3 octet 192 | 168 | 0 never change 
       
        The first IP is reserved for networking and the last IP is reserved for broadcast 

        256=2 = 254 hosts created 

        Formula to calculate how many hosts get created means 2^32-n  ==> n = /24 so 2^32-24 = 2^8 = 256 

        for 10.0.0.0/20  ==>  20 is CIDR means 20 bits block so 10.0. these two completely blocked and next 0 opens up like 8 bits and block 4 bits from those 8 bits.
             ==> 2^32-n ==> 2^32-20 = 2^12 = 4096
        
        for 172.31.0.0/16 ==> 16 is CIDR =  2^32-n = 2^32-16 = 2^16 = 65536 IPs can generate 
        
           172.31 got blocked as 16 bits blocked and remaining 0.0 ==> 0-255 | 0-255 possible IPs
                                                                        256  *  256  = 65536 


        ***** 192.168.0.0/22  ==> 2^32-22 ==> 2^10 ==> 1024-5 = 1019 IPs 
             
              5 IPs are reserved ==> 

              1st ==> Networking
              II ==> DNS 
              III ==> Route 
              IV ==> Future Purpose 
              last ==> Broadcast

              **** What CIDR are allowed for VPC(Virtual Private Cloud) in AWS :
              
                             
              /28
              . 
              . 
              . 
              /18 
              /17 
              /16 

              It does not support less than /16 or more than /28.
