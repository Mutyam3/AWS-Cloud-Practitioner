         ==> What is Cloud Computing ? 

         For Example   usage of Electricity 

         using computing as a utility   (Pay as you use)

         Access services on demand 
         Avoid large upfront investments 
         Provision computing resources as needed (whenever it required)
         pay only for what you use 


         ** Cloud computinf is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

         Instead of buying, owning and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, 
         such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Service(AWS).

         we need internet to access all these things. 

         ==>  Service modes of cloud computing :

         ** What are Cloud Computing service models ? 

         SaaS, Paas, and laaS are the three main cloud computing service model categories. 

         You can access all three via an Internet browser or online apps available on different devices. 

              Software as a service - top layer 
              Platform as  a service 
              Infrastructure as a service IaaS 

           ** Infrastructure as a service IaaS  :

              Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud computing service offering on-demand computing, storage, and networking resources. 
              It usually works on pay-as0you-go basis.

              Organizations can purchase resources on-demand and as needed instead of buying the hardware outright.

              This Model contains the basic building blocks for your web application. 
              It provides complete control over the hardware that runs your application (storage, servers, VMs, networks).


           ** Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) : 

              Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) provides a cloud computing framework for software application creation and deployment. 
              It is a platform for the deployment and management of software apps. 
              This flexible cloud computing model scales up automatically on demand.

              This Model provides all the facilities required to support the complex life cycle of building and delivering web applications and 
              services entirely for the internet. This cloud computing model enables developers to rapidly develop,run and manage their apps without 
              building and maintaining the infrastructure or platform. 

           ** Software as a Service (SaaS) :
           
              Software as a Service (SaaS) is a web-based deployment model that makes the software accessible through a web browser.
              SaaS software users don't need to care where the software is hosted, which operating system it uses, or even which programming language it is written in. 
              The SaaS software is accessible from any device with an internet connection.
